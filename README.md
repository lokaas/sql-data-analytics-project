ðŸ“‚ **Project Overview**

In this repository, you'll find a collection of SQL queries organized into different themes to help you analyze, explore, and derive insights from relational databases. The categories of queries in this repository include:

## 1. **Database Exploration**
   - Techniques for exploring the structure of the database, understanding its tables, columns, and relationships, and gaining insights into the database metadata.

## 2. **Measures and Metrics**
   - Queries designed to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs), such as total sales, total orders, average price, and other essential business metrics.

## 3. **Time-Based Trends**
   - Analyzing trends over time, identifying seasonality, and measuring growth or decline in key metrics over different time periods (e.g., monthly, yearly).

## 4. **Cumulative Analytics**
   - Queries that help in calculating cumulative metrics, such as total sales over time, to track progress and changes in performance.

## 5. **Segmentation**
   - Breaking down the data into meaningful groups based on specific criteria, such as customer demographics, product categories, or geographical regions, to understand and analyze different segments.
